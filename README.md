# LLM_Chat_Application

This is an interactive web application powered by *Meta AI's LLaMA 3.1 model* and built using Streamlit. This application provides users with a chat interface to ask questions and get responses. It can also execute SQL queries on a *local SQLite database* and display results. Additionally, the application maintains a chat history that users can review and search through.

## Features

- **Interactive Chat**: Users can input questions and receive responses generated by the LLaMA model. The responses can include SQL queries if the question involves data retrieval.
- **SQL Query Execution**: The application can execute SQL queries on a SQLite database and display the results directly within the app.
- **Chat History Management**: Chat history is automatically saved and can be reviewed or searched through a dedicated interface.
- **Configurable Environment**: API keys and other sensitive information are managed using environment variables for added security.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or later
- Required Python libraries (`streamlit`, `dotenv`, `sqlite3`, `json`, `together`)
